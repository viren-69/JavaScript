JavaScript does have a concept of "classes," but it's important to understand that these classes are syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance model. Introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), the class keyword provides a cleaner and more familiar syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance, especially for developers coming from class-based languages like Java or C++.

Key Points About JavaScript Classes:

1. Syntactic Sugar:

JavaScript classes are not fundamentally different from the prototype-based inheritance model. They are essentially a more readable and structured way to create constructor functions and manage prototypes.

2. Class Syntax:

You can define a class using the class keyword, and it can include a constructor, methods, and static methods

3. Inheritance:

JavaScript classes support inheritance using the extends keyword. This allows you to create a subclass that inherits from another class.

4. Prototype Chain:

Under the hood, JavaScript classes still use the prototype chain. When you create an instance of a class, it inherits properties and methods from the class's prototype.

5. No Real Classes:

Unlike traditional class-based languages, JavaScript does not have true classes. The class syntax is just a more convenient way to work with JavaScript's prototype-based system.
